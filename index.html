        <p class="lead mb-4">All my life I have wanted to be a teacher, always wanting to help those around me. When I entered high school though, I got involved with the club on campus for making connections with our fellow classmates with disabilities. We would put on Special Olympics events, have them exposed to social situations, and have other fun activities like dances or enjoying free time during class. My favorite part about it though, was that when I would be walking around campus, some of my peers with limited vocabulary would say hi to me. That made me feel like I had a big impact on their lives and that they felt comfortable enough to speak with me. I enjoyed it so much, and it made me specifically want to go into teaching Special Education.
<br><br>

        I decided on becoming a Liberal Studies major so that I can have a broad teaching education. During these four years, I will be studying to take my Registered Behavior Technician test so I can be certified and get a job as an one-on-one aide for schools. Once I start working as a teacher after graduation, I would like to get my masters degree in Mod-Severe Special Education, so that I can expand my knowledge even more on the subject. It would be amazing if eventually I could go on to become a professor for Special Education at a college later on in life. I also recently came up with the idea of making a childrenâ€™s book eventually, about how to be respectful towards kids with disabilities, so that kids without disabilities can be educated and kind to one another.
<br><br>

        As of right now, I am enjoying three different jobs outside of doing school and maintaining good grades. I am an AVID college tutor at Murrieta Valley High School. AVID is a program that pushes students to excel in their academics, behaviors, and in their organization. AVID stands for advancement via individual determination. I enjoy being able to tutor the students and help guide them on the right paths in life. I also do one-on-one tutoring once a week with a student outside of school hours, and I have managed to take them from being a D student, to becoming a B student in math. Lastly, I am also working a couple of hours a week with an adult on the autism spectrum, teaching him life skills. This is through an agency called RITZ FMS and I am thoroughly enjoying it as it is exactly what I want to do with my life. I come up with different activities to do with him, and since he is nonverbal he shows me communication via his tablet, which we are also working more on expanding.
